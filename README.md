### How to move?
At their turn, each player can drag and drop tiles onto the game board to make a word. To play the word and check it, the player clicks the 'Play' button. The first word played must start at the star. The player has the ability to pass their turn or exchange their tiles for different ones.

## A bit of history
This game was built as an end of Quarter 1 project during my time at a 6 month web immersive program. The entire game is built using Javascript, HTML, CSS and a lot of jQuery, to showcase the skills learned during the quarter. There is no data persistence and the game uses only a subset of Scrabble rules.
